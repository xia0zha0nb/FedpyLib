# FedpyLib
## About Author
This library is created by xiaozhaonb.
It will update by a team of developers named MadCode Studio.
**Tips: Because the author is Chinese, the annotations and naming in some projects will be more localized, and if you don't understand, you can ask some Chinese friends around you.**
**Tips2: The author is a junior high school student, and his studies are more heavy, so it is difficult to find a lot of time to update this library, you can submit some issues on github, and the author will take time to read (of course, because of the "wall" of the Chinese network, the author may not be able to log in to github)**
